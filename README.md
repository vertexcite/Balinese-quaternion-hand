========================

Mathematica to create animation showing 720 degree rotation as loop in SU(2) being collapsed to a point, demonstrating that SU(2) is simply connected.

Glossary
--------
* SO(3) is the special orthogonal group of dimension 3.  It represents rotation transformations in 3D.  It's definition is the set of 3x3 real orthogonal matrices with determinant equal to 1.

* SU(2) is the special unitary group of dimension 2. It is isomorphic to the space of unit quaternions, which is a double cover of SO(3), which in this context means that rotations of 360 degrees are treated as distinct from rotations of 720 degrees.  The definition of SU(2) is the set of 2x2 complex unitary matrices with determinant equal to 1.

* Double cover (rough definition): A smooth manifold such that a diffeomorphism exists to another smooth manifold such that exactly 2 distinct points on the first manifold are mapped to any given point on the second manifold.
